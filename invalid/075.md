# No Storage gap for upgradable base contracts `OrderProcessor`, `BuyOrderIssuer`

## Summary
OrderProcessor is base contract for SellOrderProcessor/BuyOrderIssuer, BuyOrderIssuer is base contract for DirectBuyIssuer.

But they are missing storage gap.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity 
contract BuyOrderIssuer is OrderProcessor {
    ...
    /// ------------------ State ------------------ ///

    /// @dev orderId => FeeState
    mapping(bytes32 => FeeState) private _feeState;

    // @audit - missing storage gap 
```

```solidity 
contract is OrderProcessor {
    ...

    /// ------------------ State ------------------ ///

    /// @notice Address to receive fees
    address public treasury;

    /// @notice Fee specification contract
    IOrderFees public orderFees;

    /// @dev Are orders paused?
    bool public ordersPaused;

    /// @dev Total number of active orders. Onchain enumeration not supported.
    uint256 private _numOpenOrders;

    /// @dev Active orders
    mapping(bytes32 => OrderState) private _orders;
    
    // Used order ids
    mapping(bytes32 => bool) private _orderIds;

    // @audit - missing storage gap 
```

## Impact
Upgrade of base contract's storage layout might override inheriting contract' storage layout.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add following storage gap for `OrderProcessor.sol`, `BuyOrderIssuer.sol`

```solidity 
contract BuyOrderIssuer is OrderProcessor {
    ...
    /// ------------------ State ------------------ ///

    /// @dev orderId => FeeState
    mapping(bytes32 => FeeState) private _feeState;

    // @audit - missing storage gap 
+    uint256    _gap[50];
```

```solidity 
contract is OrderProcessor {
    ...

    /// ------------------ State ------------------ ///

    /// @notice Address to receive fees
    address public treasury;

    /// @notice Fee specification contract
    IOrderFees public orderFees;

    /// @dev Are orders paused?
    bool public ordersPaused;

    /// @dev Total number of active orders. Onchain enumeration not supported.
    uint256 private _numOpenOrders;

    /// @dev Active orders
    mapping(bytes32 => OrderState) private _orders;
    
    // Used order ids
    mapping(bytes32 => bool) private _orderIds;

    // @audit - missing storage gap 
+    uint256    _gap[50];
```
